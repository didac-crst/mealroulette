# Scheduler

## Document metadata

- **Purpose:** Family-vector similarity and how it relates to weekly target matching.
- **Authority:** Canonical for scheduler vector math; weekly target semantics also in [computed-traits.md](computed-traits.md) and [meal-composition.md](meal-composition.md); composed-pair compatibility is in [pair-compatibility-reroll.md](pair-compatibility-reroll.md).
- **Status:** Living — update when scheduler scoring changes.
- **Update when:** `targets.py` or neighbour/scoring rules change.

Rules for automatic meal roulette: family-vector similarity, weekly targets, and scoring. Implementation lives in `backend/mealroulette/services/scheduler/`. Product behaviour (reroll, generate week, scheduled job, Telegram) is in [CURSOR_ROADMAP.md](../CURSOR_ROADMAP.md#phase-8---explainable-scheduler).

Composable meal pair compatibility and reroll memory are specified separately in [pair-compatibility-reroll.md](pair-compatibility-reroll.md).

**Purpose:** similarity between dishes for history-aware roulette. **Weekly targets** use main-recipe **computed traits** first (`fish`, `meat`, `pasta`, `rice`, `vegetarian`, …), with **curated style tags** as fallback for non-derivable classifications (e.g. `soup`). See `mealroulette.services.scheduler.targets`.

**Not in scope:** ML embeddings (see [SPECS.md §10](../../SPECS.md#10-meal-similarity-logic)).

## 1. Dish family vector

Built **on the fly** when the scheduler runs. Not stored in the database.

**Input:** main recipe ingredient lines + normalized `Ingredient` rows from the catalog.

**Output:** sparse dict `family → weight_pct` where weights are **L1-normalized percentages** (sum = 100). Absent keys = 0.

### 1.1 Ingredient line → grams

Each recipe line is converted to a **reference mass in grams**. This is approximate — only for similarity, not shopping lists.

| Unit dimension | Conversion rule |
| --- | --- |
| **Mass** | Convert to g using standard unit table (`mealroulette.services.quantities`). |
| **Volume** | Convert to ml when a path exists; then treat **1 ml = 1 g**. If no volume conversion exists, treat raw quantity as grams equivalent (**1 unit = 1 g** per ml fallback step). |
| **Count** | See [§1.2 Count → grams](#12-count--grams). |

If quantity is missing or zero, skip the line.

### 1.2 Count → grams

Priority order:

1. **Approved** ingredient-specific conversion where `from_unit` is `unit` (or count) and `to_unit` is `g` — use `quantity × factor`.
2. Else **default fallback:** **`100 g × quantity`** per count (household reference; configurable in `planning_rules.rules_json` as `default_grams_per_count`, default `100`).

Do **not** skip count lines when no conversion exists — always apply step 2.

### 1.3 Ingredient → family key

Map each line to a rollup key:

1. `ingredient.family` if set (preferred — from seed, e.g. `tomato_family`, `pasta_family`).
2. Else `ingredient.category` (e.g. `vegetable`, `meat`).
3. Else `ingredient.canonical_name` as last resort.

If no key after step 3, skip the line.

### 1.4 Lines excluded before rollup

Excluded lines do not contribute grams (keeps vectors sparse; negligible effect on similarity):

| Rule | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Converted mass **&lt; `vector_min_grams`** (default **5 g**) | Drops pinch-sized salt/spices; negligible after normalize. |

Configurable in `planning_rules.rules_json`:

```json
{
  "vector_min_grams": 5,
  "default_grams_per_count": 100
}
```

### 1.5 Rollup and normalize

1. Sum grams per family key.
2. **L1-normalize:** `weight_pct(f) = 100 × grams(f) / total_grams` (if `total_grams == 0`, empty vector).

### 1.6 Dynamic vocabulary

Vectors are **dicts**, not fixed-length arrays. Only families present in a dish appear. A new family in the ingredient seed adds a new key — existing dishes unchanged.

When comparing two dishes, iterate the **union of keys** (typically small).

---

## 2. Similarity between dishes

**Metric:** cosine similarity on sparse percentage dicts.

```python
cosine(a, b) = dot(a, b) / (||a|| × ||b||)
similarity_distance = 1 - cosine(a, b)   # 0 = identical, 1 = orthogonal
similarity = 1 - similarity_distance     # 1 = identical, 0 = orthogonal
```

- Range: `similarity_distance ∈ [0, 1]` for non-negative vectors.
- **Not used for:** weekly target checks (traits + style-tag fallback handle those).
- **Tags are not merged into the family vector.** Pasta vs rice similarity comes from overlapping ingredient families; weekly targets use computed traits from the main recipe, not the vector.

---

## 3. Temporal neighbours (similarity context)

Similarity is **not** eaten-history-only. At scoring time for slot **S**, build a neighbour list:

| Source | Included when | `source` label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Eaten meals** | `abs(S.date − E.date) ≤ avoid_similar_meals_within_days` | `eaten` |
| **Locked / manual / other assigned plan meals** | same window, same week plan | `planned` |
| **Slots already filled earlier in this generation attempt** | same window | `generated` |

The slot being filled is **excluded** from its own neighbour list.

**Temporal weight** uses **calendar distance**, symmetric for past and future:

```python
days_apart = abs(S.date - neighbour.date)
temporal_weight = max(0.2, 1.0 - days_apart / history_window_days)
```

Example: rerolling **Tue** with **Fri** locked to risotto → `days_apart = 3`. Planning **Thu** with similar dish on **Fri** → `days_apart = 1` → **stronger** penalty than a neighbour 4 days away.

### 3.1 Similarity penalty

For each candidate dish **D** and slot **S**:

1. **Same dish ID** as any meal in `avoid_same_dish_within_days` → **hard exclude** (eaten or planned).
2. Else for each neighbour **N** in the temporal window:
   - `similarity = 1 − similarity_distance(vector(D), vector(N))`
   - `penalty contribution = temporal_weight(|S.date − N.date|) × similarity`
3. **Penalty** = max contribution over neighbours (most similar close neighbour wins).

If `similarity ≥ similarity_threshold` (default **0.75**, meaning cosine ≥ 0.75) → selection reason: *“Similar to [dish] on [date] (shared families: …)”*.

If all neighbours are far (`min distance ≥ 0.45`) → reason: *“Good variety vs neighbouring meals …”*.

## 4. Sequential week generation

The generator fills slots **in calendar order** (Mon lunch → Mon dinner → …). Each pick sees:

| Signal | Aware of earlier picks in same run? |
| --- | --- |
| Weekly targets | Yes — via `assigned_dish_ids` |
| Same dish twice in week | Yes — hard block |
| Similarity penalty | Yes — via `generated` neighbours |
| Locked / manual meals | Yes — via `planned` neighbours |
| Eaten history | Yes — via `eaten` neighbours |

**Algorithm:** up to `plan_attempts` (default 50) full passes. Each pass fills all open slots in order; keep the pass with highest total score. Per slot: filter hard constraints → score → take top 5 → weighted random pick.

**Composable simple-dish catalogs (Phase 12):** centerpiece×side pairing can explode when many simple dishes exist. The generator bounds exploration per slot:

| Control | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Centerpiece shortlist | top 8 by score + 7 random from the remainder (max 15) |
| Side shortlist | top 12 by score + 13 random from the remainder (max 25) |
| Scoring | each eligible main/centerpiece/side scored once per slot; pair total reuses those scores |
| Adaptive attempts | when `centerpieces × sides > 2000`, effective attempts drop to `min(plan_attempts, max(15, plan_attempts // 2))`; above 10 000 pairs, `min(plan_attempts, max(10, plan_attempts // 3))` |

Example: 94 centerpieces and 88 sides (8 272 pair space) runs 25 attempts instead of 50. Random shortlist slots use the same generator RNG as week generation (deterministic when seeded).

Manual benchmark against a live DB: `python backend/scripts/benchmark_generate_week.py`.

## 5. Traits, tags, and vectors (reminder)

| Mechanism | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Computed traits** (main recipe) | Weekly targets (`fish`, `meat`, `pasta`, `rice`, `vegetarian`, …) |
| **Curated style tags** | Fallback for non-derivable targets (e.g. `soup`); temperature and legacy carb/protein tags where still used |
| **Family vector** | Similarity to temporal neighbours only |
| **Seasonality** | Soft score per slot month |
| **Ratings** | Soft boost from household ratings |

---

## 6. Roulette API and undo

| Endpoint | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/meal-plans/{id}/generate` | Fill all regenerable slots; preserve locked/manual/past |
| `POST /api/meal-plans/{id}/generate/details` | Same + warnings, variety assessment, scores |
| `POST /api/meal-plan-items/{id}/reroll` | Replace one slot (today/future, unlocked) |
| `POST /api/meal-plan-items/{id}/reroll/details` | Same + metadata |
| `POST /api/meal-plans/{id}/undo-roulette` | Restore **last** generate or reroll snapshot |

**Undo:** one level only. Before each generate/reroll, snapshot affected items (`dish_id`, `recipe_id`, `selection_reasons_json`, `manually_selected`) into `meal_plans.last_roulette_undo_json`. Undo restores and clears the snapshot.

**Variety assessment** (for UI review): per new assignment, nearest temporal neighbour + distance label (`very similar` … `very different`). No 2D embedding.

---

## 7. Meal swap (manual rebalance)

`POST /api/meal-plan-items/{id}/swap` with `{ "target_item_id": … }`.

**Pure exchange** of `dish_id`, `recipe_id`, and `selection_reasons_json` between two **planned** slots in the same week (today or future). No similarity checks, no target recalculation — manual rebalance only (same philosophy as leftovers and manual picks).

Lock flags stay on each slot; only the dishes move.

### 7.1 Plan from dish gallery

`POST /api/meal-plan-items/assign` with `{ "date", "meal_slot", "dish_id", "recipe_id?" }`.

Creates the meal-plan week if needed, assigns the dish to the chosen lunch/dinner slot (today or future), sets `manually_selected=true`, and clears auto `selection_reasons_json`. UI entry points: dish library card **Plan for…** and dish detail page.

---

## 8. Scheduled roulette (worker)

Configured in **`scheduler_settings`** (admin UI `/settings/scheduler`, API `GET/PUT /api/scheduler/settings`).

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | false | Worker runs job when true |
| `run_weekday` | 4 (Friday) | Local weekday to trigger |
| `run_time` | 18:00 | Local time (with `timezone`) |
| `target_week_offset` | 1 | 0 = this Mon–Sun, 1 = next week, etc. |
| `notify_telegram` | true | Broadcast after successful generate |
| `notify_planning_days` | 7 | Days of plan shown in Telegram HTML |

**Worker:** minute cron (same as daily Telegram reminder). `ScheduledRouletteService.run_scheduled()` skips unless `should_run_scheduled`: on the configured local weekday, at or after `run_time`, once per local calendar day.

**On trigger:** `get_or_create_plan(target_week)` → `generate_week` → optional **“New roulette”** HTML message to Telegram subscribers (reuses planning formatter).

**Manual:** `POST /api/scheduler/run-roulette` (admin) runs immediately regardless of schedule.

## 9. Selection reasons (example)

```json
{
  "reasons": [
    "Good variety vs neighbouring meals (min distance 0.52)",
    "Helps fish target (1/2 this week)"
  ],
  "score": 1.85,
  "similarity_distance_max": 0.52
}
```

---

## 10. Tests (required)

- Mass, volume, count conversions and vector normalize (see slice 2 tests).
- Temporal weight symmetry; closer neighbours penalize more.
- Future locked meals affect scoring.
- Sequential generation: later slot sees earlier pick as neighbour.
- Generate / reroll / undo API; swap exchange; Phase 8 acceptance API tests (`test_scheduler_acceptance.py`).
- Locked meals preserved; past slots blocked.
